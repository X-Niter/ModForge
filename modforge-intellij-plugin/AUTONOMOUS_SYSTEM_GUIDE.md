# ModForge Autonomous Development System Guide

This guide explains how to interact with the ModForge Autonomous Development System - an AI-driven development platform that can generate, modify, test, and improve code without human intervention.

## 1. System Overview

The ModForge Autonomous System is designed to:

- **Continuously monitor** your codebase for errors and improvement opportunities
- **Self-fix issues** by creating pull requests with corrections
- **Implement features** based on natural language descriptions
- **Have conversations** with developers through GitHub issues and comments
- **Self-test changes** to ensure they work correctly before committing
- **Learn from patterns** to improve over time
- **Provide metrics and analysis** through a GitHub Pages dashboard

## 2. Conversation Interface

The most natural way to interact with the system is through GitHub's native interfaces:

### 2.1 Starting a Conversation

1. **Create a new issue** with a title describing what you want
2. **Describe your request** in the issue body using natural language
3. **Wait for response** - the system will automatically analyze and respond

Example issue title: "Add a dark mode feature to the settings panel"

### 2.2 Continuing Conversations

The system maintains full conversation history and context:

1. **Reply to comments** as you would with a human developer
2. **Ask follow-up questions** to get more information
3. **Request changes** to what the AI has suggested or implemented
4. **Approve or suggest revisions** for PRs created by the system

Example comment: "That looks good, but can you also add a keyboard shortcut for toggling the dark mode?"

### 2.3 Command Language

For more structured interactions, you can use slash commands in any issue or comment:

| Command | Syntax | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Fix | `/fix [target]` | Fix issues in a file or component |
| Improve | `/improve [target]` | Enhance code quality in a specific file |
| Document | `/document [target]` | Add documentation to a file |
| Add | `/add [feature] to [target]` | Add a new feature to a component |
| Analyze | `/analyze [target]` | Deep analysis of code or component |
| Explain | `/explain [target]` | Explain how code works |
| Test | `/test [target]` | Create or run tests for a component |
| Implement | `/implement [all\|indices]` | Implement suggested improvements |
| Refactor | `/refactor [target]` | Restructure code while preserving functionality |
| Help | `/help` | Show command reference |

Examples:
```
/fix GenerateCodeAction.java
/improve error handling
/document AIServiceManager.java
/add "theme selector dropdown" to SettingsPanel
/analyze performance bottlenecks
/explain the pattern recognition system
/test UIComponents
/implement all
/refactor data structures
```

## 3. Autonomous Workflows

The system has several automatic workflows that run without human intervention:

### 3.1 Autonomous Scanning

Every 3 hours, the system:
1. Compiles the codebase
2. Runs code quality checks
3. Analyzes the results with AI
4. If issues are found:
   - Creates an issue with detailed diagnostics
   - Proposes fixes
   - Can automatically create a PR with fixes

### 3.2 Proactive Improvements

Every 6 hours, the system:
1. Analyzes the codebase for improvement opportunities
2. Identifies documentation gaps, performance issues, or architectural improvements
3. Creates an issue with suggested improvements
4. Waits for approval before implementing

### 3.3 Dependency Updates

Weekly, the system:
1. Checks for dependency updates
2. Tests compatibility with newer versions
3. Creates a PR updating dependencies if tests pass

### 3.4 Pull Request Analysis

When any PR is created or updated:
1. The system reviews the changes
2. Provides code review comments
3. Suggests improvements
4. Can implement requested changes

## 4. Self-Governance Mechanisms

The autonomous system has safeguards to prevent issues:

### 4.1 Testing Before Committing

Before committing any changes, the system:
1. Runs compilation tests
2. Executes existing unit tests
3. Performs static analysis
4. Only proceeds if tests pass

### 4.2 Human Approval for Major Changes

For significant changes, the system:
1. Creates a detailed issue explaining the proposed changes
2. Waits for human approval
3. Implements only after receiving explicit permission

### 4.3 Rollback Capability

If issues are detected after changes:
1. The system can automatically revert problematic changes
2. Creates an issue explaining what happened
3. Records the pattern to avoid similar issues in the future

## 5. Interacting with PRs

When the system creates a pull request:

### 5.1 Review Process

1. Examine the changes as you would with a human PR
2. Comment with questions or concerns
3. The AI will respond to your comments with explanations or updates
4. Request changes if needed
5. Approve when satisfied

### 5.2 Additional Requests

You can request additional changes directly in the PR:
1. Comment with `/add "feature description"` to request an addition
2. Use `/improve specific-file.java` to request improvements to certain files
3. Ask natural language questions about the implementation

## 6. Best Practices

To get the most out of the autonomous system:

### 6.1 Be Specific

- Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- Specify which files or components to modify
- Include examples when possible

### 6.2 Review Suggested Changes

- Always review automatically generated PRs
- Provide feedback to help the system improve
- Merge only when you're satisfied with the changes

### 6.3 Use the Dashboard

- Monitor the GitHub Pages dashboard
- Check autonomous activity metrics
- Use the command interface for specific actions

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### 7.1 Check Recent Activity

1. Look at recent automated issues and PRs
2. Check workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
3. Review the dashboard metrics

### 7.2 Reset Conversations

If the AI seems confused:
1. Create a new issue instead of continuing a long thread
2. Clearly state the context and problem
3. Use specific commands rather than general requests

### 7.3 Manual Intervention

For critical issues:
1. Disable workflows temporarily if needed
2. Make manual changes
3. Re-enable workflows when fixed

## 8. Example Interactions

### Example 1: Adding a Feature

**User (in a new issue):**
```
I need a feature that allows users to export their settings to a JSON file.
```

**AI Response:**
```
I'll implement that feature for you. This would involve:

1. Adding a new export button to the settings panel
2. Creating a service to convert settings to JSON
3. Implementing a file save dialog
4. Adding error handling

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?
```

**User:**
```
Yes, please proceed. Also make sure it handles special characters correctly.
```

**AI creates a PR and comments:**
```
I've implemented the settings export feature in PR #123.

The implementation:
- Adds an export button to the settings panel
- Creates a SettingsExportService for JSON conversion
- Uses JFileChooser for the save dialog
- Handles special characters with proper encoding
- Includes error handling with user feedback
- Adds unit tests

Please review when you have a chance.
```

### Example 2: Fixing Errors

**Autonomous system creates an issue:**
```
# Build Error Detected

## Diagnosis
I've detected a NullPointerException in the MetricsPanel class when the API key is not configured.

## Affected Files
- src/main/java/com/modforge/intellij/plugin/ui/MetricsPanel.java

## Suggested Fix
```java
// Add null check before calling the API client
if (apiKey != null && !apiKey.isEmpty()) {
    apiClient.fetchMetrics();
} else {
    displayErrorMessage("API key not configured");
}
```

I've created PR #124 with this fix. Please review when convenient.
```

### Example 3: Command-Based Interaction

**User (in any issue or PR):**
```
/analyze SettingsPanel.java
```

**AI Response:**
```
# Analysis of `SettingsPanel.java`

## Overview
This class handles the UI for plugin settings with 3 main components:
- API key configuration
- Pattern learning settings
- Continuous development options

## Architecture
- Uses IntelliJ's FormBuilder pattern
- State management through ApplicationSettings service
- Event handling with lambda expressions

## Potential Improvements
1. Input validation is minimal - could add more robust validation
2. Error handling could be improved in the API key verification
3. UI components could be extracted to separate classes for better maintainability

Would you like me to implement any of these improvements?
```

## 9. Advanced Usage

### Pattern Learning

The system learns patterns from successful implementations:

1. When a fix or improvement is accepted, the system records the pattern
2. Similar issues in the future can be resolved without API calls
3. This reduces API costs and improves response time
4. Pattern matching improves over time as more code is processed

### Custom Commands

For specific project needs, custom commands can be added:

1. Create an issue describing the custom command you need
2. The system will implement the command handler
3. You can then use the new command in issues and comments

Example: `/benchmark [component]` to run performance tests on a component

## 10. Understanding Autonomous Issues

The system creates different types of issues:

### Error Detection Issues

- Created when build errors are found
- Include diagnostic information
- Often come with a PR fixing the error

### Improvement Suggestion Issues

- Proactive suggestions for code quality
- List numbered improvement opportunities
- Allow you to implement all or select individual items

### Status Update Issues

- Created when all tests pass but the system wants guidance
- Summarize recent activity
- Ask for direction on what to focus on next

### Feature Completion Issues

- Created when a requested feature is implemented
- Include a summary of what was done
- Link to the PR with the implementation
